<h2>
<a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h2>

<p>Since I couldn't find a native Android app for Crestron systems, I figured I might as well make my own. 
It was called HomeAutomationApp because that was the original purpose of the app for me, but it serverd as a generic Crestron Android app meant for customization to your needs. In the first version I made my own SIMPL module, but that did not allow multiple connections. Once I found an example of the CIP Crestron protocol on GitHub, I modified all the code to use that protocol instead.  I still couldnt find the whole protocol, so I implemented only the parts that were known. If you have the document, please send it to me and I can try to implement more features if they make sense.</p>

<h3>
<a name="android-23" class="anchor" href="#android-23"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Android 2.3</h3>

<p>My original testing was limited to a 800x480 Android 2.3.3 phone, however as things got newer and better (i.e. more mods released), I have have been making to incorporate those added features. The current android 2.3 version is on branch, and will not receive any further updates</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h2>

<p>With this app you can add buttons, seekbars, or textviews linked to the XPanel (eControl for PC) Digital/Analog/Serial inputs and outputs. All that is necessary is to update the res\ folder (drawable and layouts) to include the images and layouts that you want for the app. I incorporated the built in ViewPager (with TitleStrip) which allows you to "fling" on non-input items so that you can have multiple pages.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the Android SDK</li>
<li>Load the project and build</li>
<li>Customize to your needs, changing only the res folder</li>
</ol><h3>
<a name="configuring" class="anchor" href="#configuring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuring</h3>

<ul>
<li>The IP, Port, and XPanel IDs are dynamic and can change in the app once you load it. However, you may also choose to edit the <a href="https://github.com/stealthflyer/CrestronXPanelApp/blob/master/CrestronXPanelApp/CrestronXPanelApp/res/values/strings.xml">strings</a> file to your defaults</li>
<li>The views need to be customized, use the examples <a href="https://github.com/stealthflyer/CrestronXPanelApp/blob/master/CrestronXPanelApp/CrestronXPanelApp/res/layouts/first.xml">first</a> | <a href="https://github.com/stealthflyer/CrestronXPanelApp/blob/master/CrestronXPanelApp/res/layouts/second.xml">second</a> | <a href="https://github.com/stealthflyer/CrestronXPanelApp/blob/master/CrestronXPanelApp/CrestronXPanelApp/res/layouts/third.xml">third</a> as a starting point, and use the built in editor to make it look good</li>
<li>To add or remove views, update the <a href="https://github.com/stealthflyer/CrestronXPanelApp/blob/master/CrestronXPanelApp/CrestronXPanelApp/res/xml/layouts.xml">res/xml/layouts</a> file</li>
<li>Special keys supported:

<ul>
<li>mute = toggles when phone call received</li>
<li>pause/play = goes high (if needed) when phone call occurs - use the toggle in SIMPL feedback to aid</li>
<li>sideup/sidedown = connects the volume keys to a button</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>I also have C# and Python (GLADE) versions of this app if you want a Windows/Mac/Linux mechanism to control your Crestron system. Let me know if you are interested or if you need help. </p>
