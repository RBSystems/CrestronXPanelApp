Since I couldnt find a native Android app for Crestron systems, I figured I might as well make my own. It is called HomeAutomationApp because that was the original purpose of the app for me, but it is a generic Crestron Android app meant for customization to your needs. In the first version I made my own SIMPL module, but that did not allow multiple connections. Once I found an example of the CIP Crestron protocol on GitHub, I modified all the code to use that protocol instead.  I still couldnt find the whole protocol, so I implemented only the parts that were known. If you have the document, please send it to me and I can try to implement more features if they make sense.

With this app you can add buttons, seekbars, or textviews linked to the XPanel (eControl for PC) Digital/Analog/Serial inputs and outputs. All that is necessary is to update the res\ folder (drawable and layouts) to include the images and layouts that you want for the app. I incorporated a view flipper (allows you to "fling" on non-input items) so that you can have multiple pages. Note that my original testing was limited to a 800x480 Android 2.3.3 phone, however I have been making updates for the Nexus tablet.

I also have C# and Python (GLADE) versions of this app if you want a Windows/Mac/Linux mechanism to control your Crestron system. Let me know if you are interested or if you need help.
